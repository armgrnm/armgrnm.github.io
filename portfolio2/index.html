			<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:24px;text-indent:50px;">Aichwan, also known as Airie Mae Geronimo is a believer of the skies, with the stars in her eyes - an artist, writer, and leader in one and a billion cosmos. As the comets come undone in the universe, 
			she grasps them in her hands and uses them to becone her high. To the world, she is an enigma. What is art, she would always say. Drawing? Painting? Crafting? 
			What else should or could it be? Just like love and knowledge, it comes in all shapes and forms. Fresh out of black and white, between dreams and realities, from words to paragraphs, by littles and wholes; 
			one thing's for sure, we are who defines art.</p>

			<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:24px;text-indent:50px;">Airie Mae Geronimo, in all other worlds, should definitely be your most average 21-year-old woman but in this world, she's more than that. At this budding age, she's already a leader of an esports organization, Serpents
			Esports. While working, she is also a Multimedia Arts student in De La Salle-College of Saint benilde who specializes in graphic design, illustrations, digital poster making, crafting handmade accessories, traditional arts,
			and the like. Lastly, she has lived her whole life in Metro Manila, she could only dream of travelling to the suburbs or abroad for a change, alas in the future that may be her destiny.</p>
